C+ is a language that compiles directly to C. It maintains C's power while making it easier to understand and read. With one-to-one line translation, experienced C developers can translate their code into C+ with ease. The compiler, written in Python, has helpful and descriptive error messages to help the average developer. C+ is designed to get new people into C without the headaches but with the power. Let's see what you can make!
